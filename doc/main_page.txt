 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * 
 *
 * OpenVideo is a general data integration and processing software with special support for video data. 
 * It implements a hardware abstraction layer by interfacing several different 
 * device drivers either directly or through the functionality of a third party video libraries. OpenVideo is designed to be as 
 * extensible and easily configurable as possible. OpenVideo is currently implemented on windows and on linux systems. We  
 * distribute OpenVideo under the Gnu Public License (GPL). See the file COPYING for details about licensing.\n
 * \n
 * OpenVideo's functionality is split into two parts, the 'Core' and the 'Nodes' modules. The Core module is 
 * responsible for setting up the runtime environment as well as for processing the various entities in OpenVideo's 
 * runtime data structure. This runtime structure is implemented as a directed acyclic graph which consists of nodes and edges 
 * which are implemented in the 'Nodes' module. For a detailed description on the functionality of OpenVideo's modules 
 * please refer to the section <a href="modules.html">'Modules'</a>. 
 * \n
